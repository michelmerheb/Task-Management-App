# Task Management App

## Overview
This is a task management app built using React.js with TypeScript and Bootstrap. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Xwitch between 2 Tabs, one for Active Tasks, and the other for Completed Tasks

## Technologies Used
- React.js: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- Bootstrap: Frontend framework for styling and layout
- Git: Version control system for tracking changes in codebase


## Challenges Faced
1. **Styling**: I found Bootstrap's CSS classes a little bit difficult to work with, that's why I didn't give the app a special design. I even used an external helper to help me set up bootstrap in React Js project. Although I have not gotten on with Boostrap yet, I am now familiar with TailwindCSS, as I spent time learning it this week, and I gotta say that I loved it so much.
2. **State Management**: Managing state across components, especially for moving the Tasks from Active Tasks ta to Completed Tasks tab, and vice versa.

## Future Improvements
- **Bootstrap basics**: Mastering the basics of Bootstrap is a must. Although, I prefer to work with TailWindCSS, as a front-end developer my job is to learn as many frameworks and libraries as I can.
